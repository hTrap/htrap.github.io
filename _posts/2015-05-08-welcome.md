It was last year when I purchased my domain name thetechtrap.com, it sounded cool, was available(also it had *htrap*
in the end \0/) ,so i took it. Soon
I had a hostgator *Baby plan*(:p) and was hooked to setup my blog on wordpress.
My journey took a halt with the dilemna of having an apt theme and the correct
set of plugins. Who can start blogging without them, right? So i ended up
making four different websites(on that same baby plan hosting ;)) for my
friends by adding features that they wanted but my own website wasi just my
playground for experimenting wordpress themes and plugins.

Finally I came to the conclusion that having a lot of options will just confuse
me, so
i took down that baby plan and started with github pages, a playground for developers. I wanted something simple like
on [Mark Dotto](http://www.markdotto.com) and [Zach Holman's](http://www.zackholman.com)
blog.So i ended up using my current theme.

I hope that my laziness cannot keep up with this new endeavour of mine and i keep
on posting regular blogs, because I have had ideas for blog posts in the past
which only existed on paper until that paper got lost :p. I'll aim small and go
for 1 blog a week, which I might raise if i start to enjoy it.

I have yet not updated the `CNAME` file of this repo to thetechtrap.com , would
do it once i reach 10 blogs, just to be sure of my consistency or else the url
would be too good to be used by my lazy blog. For now
[htrap.github.io](http://htrap.github.io) should
suffice.
